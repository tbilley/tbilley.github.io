		<p>I have been cooking since I can remember. Typically I am the one in the cooking cooking for major holidays when my extended family comes over. I love combining random ingredients so what I come up with. Luckily most of the time it works out well! Other times there are delivery services used as back up! Below you will find some of my favorite and "go-to" meals to make. I have also included a link if you wanted to give them a try!</p>

		<p>Salad is always a safe bet! You can keep it as simple or as complex as you would like.My go to salad is a Kale ceasar salad. I wasn't to big on kale but once you massage it with olive oil it develops a completely different taste!</p>

		<p>This dish is by far my go to! Lasagna is probably the first dish I have mastered! I got to the point where I don't use the recipe because I have remixed it over the years and make it from scratch.  </p>

		<p>Lastly here is my go to dessert. Cookies are one of the fastest things that you could make and for the most part it is tough to mess up!</p>
