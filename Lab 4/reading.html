		<h2>Reading</h2>
		<img src="img/reading.jpg" alt="a book" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
		<p>During Covid I spent a lot of time reading. There was only so much tv I could watch, so I gravitated to books. Before covid, I would typically only find time to read on my commute in the mornings and the afternoons. But during covid, my frequency of finishing books dramatically increased. Below you will find a lot the past books I have reead and any news in the "publishing industry"</p>

		<h4>What am I currently reading:</h4>
		<img src="img/book.jpg" alt="the mountain is you" style="width:300px;height:300px;">
		<p>"This is a book about self-sabotage. Why we do it, when we do it, and how to stop doing itâ€”for good. Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile. But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential. For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb. In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves." </p>
